story:
  Everyone was nervous.  This was day one of a quickstart, and noone really knew what to expect.  Definitely no one wanted to take the first step or look "goofy".  So Jeff did it for them.  "What's this all about?" He asked.  As the meeting continued, he kept asking questions that must have seemed obvious to everyone else.  But guess what?  After 1/2 an hour of Jeff being completely comfortable knowing nothing about the domain, he'd learned a whole lot, and everyone else was starting to ask silly questions too.  Of course, none of these questions were really silly.
summary:
  When there isn't enough trust, people feel the need to guard their status, instead of working toward common goals.  Lowering your status makes it okay for everyone else to lower theirs too.
problem:
  People are worried about asking for help.  About asking questions at all...
answer:
  Model the "low status" behaviors you want to encourage.
