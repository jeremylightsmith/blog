  The front-x.jpg images in this folder come from a andreas01 header image pack made
  by Andreas Viklund. These images can be used freely with the WP-Andreas01 theme,
  so you get a number of images to choose from. Below is the readme.txt from the pack:

Title: andreas01 header image pack #01
Author: Andreas Viklund
URL: http://andreasviklund.com/templates/andreas01/
Release date: May 20th, 2008

Description: These images were designed for use with the andreas01 website template.
The included images are free to use as website header images for both non-commercial
and commercial purposes, and they can be modified and edited as needed. For more
information, see the official andreas01 template page on the URL above.

Instructions: To replace the default andreas01 header image, rename the existing
front.jpg in the image directory into front-old.jpg. Then copy your selected header image
from this image pack into the template image folder. Change the filename of the new
image into front.jpg - and the new header is in place! If you want to restore the old
header, delete the new front.jpg and then rename front-old.jpg into front.jpg.

  If you like the header art but want a completely unique header, feel free to contact the
  theme designer for information about rates and availability for professional design and
