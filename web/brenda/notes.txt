Hey Brenda,

I've got a skeleton site up, and it is ready for you to take a look at it and start writing content for it.  What's up there are my suggestions so far based on our last conversation.  But remember, this is your site, and you get final say about anything.  So if you want anything changed we can talk about it and change it.

You can see it (for now) at http://jeremyandkarissa.com/brenda

I tried to put "brenda:" everywhere that I needed something from you.  Here's a list of things and / or pages that have "brenda:"s on them :

* I need pictures, a bunch, some headshots, some body, and then just some others
* Pages to go through:
  * home page
  * privates page
  * events page
  * workshops page
  * about me page
  * contact me page
* I need video, either links to where it is online, or in whatever format

Feel free to just email me a chunk of stuff at a time, and just say, for example, "on the home page, for the quick welcome : Hi, my name is brenda..."  Also, if someone else has something, like say, pictures, they can email / call me directly.

I'm of course also happy to talk to you about any of this, and I should be available by phone after 5 today, and after 3 or so the rest of the week.

Basically, the faster you get stuff to me, the faster we can put it on, the faster we can start pointing people at your site!

Jeremy

PS. Also, we never talked about how many privates for how much web work.  We probably should.  I really have no idea what's fair, but I'm completely flexible.
