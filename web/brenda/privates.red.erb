h2. What is a private lesson?

If you are confused by conflicting information in classes, or think that you have mastered something, but keep hearing it again, itâ€™s the perfect time to try a private lesson. Get your questions answered in a one-on-one setting that allows for more personal feedback.  In a private lesson you will learn what you are doing well and what needs work. You will be given tools to improve the level of your dancing, and therefore the clarity of your expression.

h2. How do private lessons with Brenda work?

Brenda teaches at her home studio, and on the road wherever space can be arranged.  If studio fees apply, they will need to be covered by the student. 

Brenda also offers individual lessons during dance weekends, which may need to be scheduled through the organizers of the event, or with Brenda personally.  Contact Brenda to find out the protocol of the particular event you are attending.

Taking notes or video taping your lesson is highly recommended to get the most of your time and money.
