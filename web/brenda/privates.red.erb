h2. What is a private lesson?

In a private lesson you will learn what you are doing well and what needs work. You will be given tools to help you master of your dance. If you are confused by conflicting information in classes, or think that you have mastered something, but keep hearing it again, it's the perfect time to try a private lesson. Get your questions answered in a one-on-one setting that allows more personal feedback. 

h2. How do private lessons work with Brenda?

Brenda teaches at her home studio, and on the road wherever space can be arranged.  If studio fees apply, they will need to be covered by the student. 

Brenda also teaches during dance weekends that may need to be arranged with the organizers of an event.

Taking notes or video taping your private is highly recommended.
