h3. Brendan Woodrow

Brendan Woodrow started dancing West Coast Swing in 2007 after hearing about it from a ballroom instructor. He immediately fell in love with the dance's smooth style and subtle movements and decided that this was a dance he should learn more about. Brendan started immersing himself in as much WCS training as he could find in Portland. He took classes from Chris Jones, Trina Siebert, and Jason Isbell as well as received private training from Brenda Collins, Glenna Cooke, and Jenica Krolicki. Currently, Brendan receives most of his training from dance coach Barry Douglas.

Since May, 2008, Brendan has been traveling the world with Brenda Collins assisting her in teaching, and training as a full time dancer. This constant immersion has accelerated his absorption of dance knowledge exponentially. He believes that his additional study in other swing dances, such as Balboa, Lindy Hop, and Blues, has greatly influenced his personal style and expanded his understanding of dance movement and physics.

When it comes to teaching, Brendan has a strong focus on foundational movement and solid dance basics. His primary goal is to take the training he is gathering as he travels and bring it back to students at home. Whether it's a tip he picked up from Lindy Hoppers in Sweden, Balboa dancers in London, or from a West Coast Swing pro in California; Brendan enjoys passing on as much of that information as possible to all of his dancing friends.
