<h3>General Classes <%= read_more ".general.classes" %></h3>
<div class="general classes">
Feedback Class
Great as a masters class, an elective, or as a tool for teacher training.  They are common at WCS events and in Invitational tracks at other Swing and Blues events.  The idea is to give pointers to individuals as the class observes so they can all benefit from each other's notes. Seeing and hearing another dancer being critiqued can help us learn something we might not be able to in a typical group class, or in a private lesson of our own.  Bring a notepad and pen and check your ego at the door.  This class is open to any dance style.

Solo Movement 
Applicable to all dance styles. We use isolations and exercises to create integration and control in our dance movement. The better we dance as individuals the more we offer as partners.
