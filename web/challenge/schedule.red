h1. Schedule

h2(day). SATURDAY

h2. The "Hidden" Closed Position Connection (Beg/Int)

Learn about a very simple "secret" connection most advanced leads and follows use - but don't even think about. This technique will enhance your connection and open up a new world of opportunities for cool moves.

h2. Musicality Clinic (All Levels) 

Get your musicality check-up this year!  This class focuses on 3 different levels of musicality (phrasing, tension, and the details), and gives you some ideas as well as lots of practice in making your dancing interpret the music within each of the 3 levels.

h2(lunch). LUNCH

h2. Vocabulary of Rhythm Variations (All Levels)

As well as giving you some stylings to make your dancing look better, this class will also give you some new ideas on how to make your dancing more interesting by adding both rhythm and lead changes to some old and new variations.

h2. The Challenge (All Levels)

This class is designed to give you a maximum variety of techniques and movements by going at the pace of the top 1-2 couples in the class.  Andrew will start off by teaching a move that involves several different lead/follow techniques in it.  Once Andrew feels that 1-2 couples have learned the move, he will move on to the next move.  This is still a rotating class and you will get to try the move with several partners.  You are not expected to get all the moves or even any one specific move.  Instead, you will get lots of pieces of moves that you can add to your own dancing to create your own moves.

h2(day). SUNDAY

h2. 101 Styles of Connection (Int/Adv)

This class will provide you with some of the most important techniques that Andrew uses in his dancing. All of the other classes during this week will use these techniques in some way or another. Those of you that have already danced a lot with partners from other dance scenes will know that there are many ways to lead and follow.  This class is interesting above all for people who want to dance flexibly enough to be able to adapt to different partners.  But even beginners that are happy to have mastered one style will find many ideas and inputs in this class to lead and follow with more awareness.  

h2. Aerial Fundamentals (All Levels)

This class breaks down the vertical connection techniques of aerials so precisely that once learned, your vertical connection both in aerials and in regular dancing will never skip a beat.  And don't worry, there are no dangerous moves in this class.

h2(lunch). LUNCH

h2. Things that make your partner go Hmmm... (All Levels) 

For the Follows, this class will teach several different "tricks" that follows can do to make the lead think she is more creative and fun to dance with. For the Leads, this class will teach you how to be receptive to your partner and how to make up moves of your own on the spot by working with your follow and her movement.

h2. Stealing Games (All Levels)

Normal dancing consists of you and a partner and the music. Imagine a dance where you are no longer connecting with just one other person but you are connecting with the entire room. In this class, you will learn several techniques to start you on your way to dancing with 2, 3, 4 or 50+ people. On a simplified level, these techniques can also be used to steal the lead or follow, whether it be during a Birthday Jam, a Stealing Jam, or just between you and some friends on the social dance floor. More importantly though, this class is a simple way to create a group connection in your dance scene and help everyone to feel like a closer community.
