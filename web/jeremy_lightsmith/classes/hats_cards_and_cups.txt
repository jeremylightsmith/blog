HATS, CARDS, AND CUPS - TECHNIQUES TO HELP TEAMS TALK

Agile teams generally prefer self organization and group decision making to command & control hierarchies.  They rely heavily on close communication and collaboration, which are skills that can be honed and learned, like anything else.

We'll be looking at techniques and tricks that a team can learn to become more effective at talking.  As teams begin to learn these tools, they'll find themselves using them in retrospectives, planning meetings, whiteboard sessions, and even while pairing. 

We'll talk about :

Six Thinking Hats - these introduce vocabulary for recognizing and switching easily between different types of thinking (or hats).

Index Cards - all the cool kids are using cards these days. We'll be looking at fast, fun ways for lots of people to brainstorm, prioritize, group, etc using cards.

Discussion Cups and other Ground Rules - it's amazing how much more effective a group discussion can be when you lay out a few labelled cups...

This is not a lecture session.  We'll split into groups and actually try all of these techniques so that you can bring them home to the teams you work on.
