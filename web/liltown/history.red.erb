h1. History

We are a mix of involved veterans and excited first-timers. Our founders have been attending burning man for 3 years. Our founders (Joshua Keroes, Jeremy Lightsmith, Karissa Lightsmith, Sara Dwyer, and Luke Haynes) have been a part of theme camps in the past. They have enjoyed sharing activities with the community such as propane soccer, random hug patrol, life-size rock-um sock-um robots, last year's White Trash Procession, and performing at Center Camp with both Trashcan Joe (2008) and the Saloon Ensemble (2007). We have had such a great time being a part of theme camps and contributing to this amazing city! This year we would also like to give back as a theme camp; this time with a new idea. We obviously want to return year after year and improve a little each time.
