			<textarea style="width: 100%; height: 250px; font-size: 12px; line-height: 14px;">Hello! I am submitting
				this support ticket because I am having trouble with your server and the
				domain <?php echo $this->brute_get_local_host(); ?>


				I have copied and pasted this message from a WordPress security plugin called BruteProtect
				(http://bruteprotect.com/). If you're not familiar with BruteProtect, it is the most effective tool
				available to keep WordPress sites from being infiltrated by distributed brute force attacks. It has also
				been shown to reduce server load by up to 70% and decrease bandwidth usage by up to 85%, so it's good
				for everyone!

				The problem we are experiencing is an inability to access the BruteProtect API
				(https://api.bruteprotect.com/) from within the plugin. When we attempt to reach the API, the following
				error(s) are returned:

				<?php if ( is_array( $error_rows ) ) :  foreach ( $error_rows as $key => $msg ) : ?>
					<?php echo $key ?>: <?php echo $msg[0] ?>
				<?php endforeach; endif; ?>


				For more information, or to test to see if this issue is fixed, you can visit:
				http://<?php echo $this->brute_get_local_host(); ?>/?bpc=<?php echo $privacy_key ?>


				If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to the team at BruteProtect:
				help@bruteprotect.com</textarea>
		</li>

	If you have an exceptionally good (or an exceptionally bad) experience with your host, let us know by sending an
