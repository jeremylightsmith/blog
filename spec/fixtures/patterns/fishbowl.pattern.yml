story: 
  It was time for an company retreat, and ThoughtWorks had gathered 200 of it's best and brightest from around the world into a giant conference room.  
  
  Martin got up and said, "We're going to have a group discussion about company issues"
  
  "How can 200 people have a discussion...?" I wondered.
  
  The rules were simple, there would be a "Fishbowl" in the middle of the room with 6 chairs around a table.  Only people sitting at this fishbowl would be allowed to talk, and there must always be a free chair so that anyone else might join the conversation.
  
  Over the next 2 hours we had a very intense and interesting dialogue about hard issues.  The CEO even sat down a couple times to argue issues with the other people in the fishbowl, but he never stayed for long.  

summary:
  Only people sitting in the "fishbowl" can talk.  Everyone else gets to listen, but it's easy to step into the 
  fishbowl because there's always a free chair.  Fishbowls can allow huge groups (100+) to have meaningful 
  discussions.
