          I have extensive experience coaching software development teams across many industries, introducing agile best practices and values, and leading my teams to deliver working software.

          I believe that leadership is about service and two-way trust.  I believe that integrity and passion are contagious, and I try to model my beliefs.

          teachers, and DJs in our community.

      <h3>Consultant / Facilitator / Agile Coach / Senior Developer</h3>
      <p>
        <ul>
          Serving ThoughtWorks, I have
          seen and been a part of real change.
          As an Extreme Programming Coach, I concentrated on gelling teams and introducing Agile Best Practices.
          As a developer, I was responsible for evolving much
          of the architecture on each of my projects at ThoughtWorks.
          During my time here, I taught unit testing workshops,
          hosted the Bay XP User Group, presented at various conferences, co-started the first GeekNight, 
          and even got a chance to pair with people
          like Ward Cunningham, Martin Fowler, Robert Martin, and Brian Marick.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p class="client">QuickStart Engagements</p>
          <p>
            I served as lead facilitator on several <i>QuickStarts</i> and developed and taught internal classes to 
            train other facilitators.  In this type of engagement, a small ThoughtWorks team facilitates intense
            working meetings with stakeholders, BAs and developers to drive out clear business goals and objectives, 
            and eventually flesh out enough requirements to kickoff an agile project.  
            I helped to pioneer <i>QuickStarts</i> within ThoughtWorks and our clients
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="client">Product: CruiseControl.rb</p>
          <p>
            Alexey Verkhovsky and I led a small development team to design and implement a ruby version of cruise control.
            We drove the product to a successful 1.0 release and beyond.  It is now the de facto 
            standard for ruby continuous integration, in use in hundreds of projects around the world. 
            Because it is open source, I am able to remain active as a lead developer today.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="client">Client: Cutting Edge Software Product Company</p>
          <p>
            I served as a
            developer &amp; architect and was called upon to share industry knowledge and best practices,
            influencing the direction of the project. This client is using and hoping to introduce
            many revolutionary technologies around Domain Specific Languages,  and has the potential
            to change software development forever.

        <li>
          <p class="client">Client: Major Financial Company</p>
          <p>
            As a coach, I brought best practices to
            the team which allowed it to grow from 5 developers in a room to 30 developers
            on 3 sites including an offshore component.
            As an architect, I was responsible for
            much of the architecture, especially an MVC framework that allowed the
            same presenters and agents/web services to be used on
            SmartClient and ASP.NET views.

          <p>
            As a team lead and senior developer on this 100+ person project, I helped 
            define their methodology and architecture. I helped write a persistence layer for the project
            and wrote the data migration framework that has now been used for
            several releases.
            Developed a bespoke oil trading application to capture and process deals
            involving physical and derivative instruments.

        <li>
          <p class="client">Client: Container Shipping Web Service</p>
          <p>
            I helped bring many best practices to the
            team, as well as to the client through mentoring. I also pioneered n-stage
            XSL transforms, developed a powerful framework for writing web
            applications, and rewrote and optimized an entity bean code generator.
