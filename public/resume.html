      <h3>Agile Coach / Senior Developer</h3>
      <ul>
          I've joined Pivotal as their first Seattle employee.  I hope to help build a local office full of the energy
          and excellence that I have seen over the best parts of my career.  My responsibilities here include
          Agile enablement and coaching of teams, as well as rails development for startups.
      </ul>
      <h2><div class='dates'>Oct 2006 - Mar 2007</div>Independent Consulting</h2>
      <h3>Ruby on Rails Development</h3>
      <ul>
        <p>
          I worked on small rails projects for local startups over this time, including a crowdsourcing site for 
          coordinating and finding project members and a small music podcasting site.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          I applied agile practices to these projects, and worked remotely on their development and delivery.

      <h3>Extreme Programming Coach / Senior Developer</h3>
      <p>
        <ul>
            Serving ThoughtWorks I have
            seen and been a part of real change.
            As an XP(Extreme Programming) coach, I concentrate on gelling teams by introducing Agile
            practices like testing, pairing, and refactoring.
            As a developer, I have been responsible for evolving much
            of the architecture on each of my projects at ThoughtWorks.
            During my time here, I have taught unit testing workshops,
            hosted the Bay XP User Group,
            presented at various conferences, co-started the first GeekNight,
            a group that meets weekly to pair on open source efforts, first in London,
            now in many cities, and I even got a chance to pair with people
            like Ward Cunningham, Martin Fowler, Robert Martin, and Brian Marick.
            I am also a member of Agilia.

        <li>
          <p><u>CruiseControl.rb</u></p>
          <p>
            ThoughtWorks brought me onto the team as a lead developer to help lead and drive development of this 
            open source project.  It is the first product to be launched as part of ThoughtWorks' new ruby based 
            product initiative. (see more below)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><u>QuickStart Engagements</u></p>
          <p>
            I have helped to pioneer <i>QuickStarts</i> within ThoughtWorks and our clients.  In this type of engagement,
            a small ThoughtWorks team facilitates working meetings with stakeholders, BAs and developers
            to drive out clear business goals and objectives, and eventually flesh out enough requirements
            to kickoff an agile project.  I have served as lead QuickStarts and taught internal classes on facilitating them.

            I served as a
            developer &amp; architect and was called upon to share industry knowledge and best practices,
            influencing the direction of the project. This client is using and hoping to introduce
            many revolutionary technologies around Domain Specific Languages,  and has the potential
            to change software development forever.

          <p><u>Client: Major Financial Company</u></p>
          <p>
            We partnered with Microsoft on a .NET prototype for a
            system that we then implemented and put into production. I was responsible for
            much of the architecture, especially an MVC framework that allowed the
            same presenters and agents/web services to be used on
            SmartClient and ASP.NET views. As a coach, I brought XP practices to
            the team which grew from 5 developers in a room to 30 developers
            on 3 sites including an offshore component.

        <li>
          <p><u>Client: Major Petroleum Company</u></p>
          <p>
            Developed a bespoke oil trading application to capture and process deals
            involving physical and derivative instruments on a 100+ person team.
            I helped define their methodology, and was a team lead and a senior
            developer on the project.  During this project, I co-developed
            the client architecture, helped write the project√≠s persistence layer,
            and wrote the data migration framework that has now been used for
            several releases.
          </p>

        <br/>
        <li>
          <p><u>Client: Container Shipping Web Service</u></p>
          <p>
            My team incrementally delivered an enterprise size
            application using and proving new technologies like Web Services, J2EE, EJB,
            XML, XSL. During this project, I helped bring many best practices to the
            team, as well as to the client through mentoring. I also pioneered n-stage
            XSL transforms, developed a powerful framework for writing web
            applications, and rewrote and optimized an entity bean code generator.

        CruiseControl.rb</h3>
        <ul>
            CruiseControl.rb is a rewrite of the original continuous integration project cruise control in ruby.  
            Fixing many of the problems of it's predecessors, it focuses on simplicity, ease of installation, and
            extensibility.  We've gotten tons of really good feedback, and I expect this to be one of the most 
            useful and widely known projects I will ever have worked on.  ThoughtWorks brought me onto this project
            as a lead developer (along with Alexey Verkhovsky) as it started.  Together we and the development team 
            drove it to a successful 1.0 release.  I am still active today as a lead developer.

            A mature GUI tester for java swing applications with record/playback capabilities.
            Tests are written/recorded in Jython using a bundled mini-IDE. Charles Lowell and
            I founded this project with Charles Lowell and I ran it as a mostly XP project for over a year.
            During this time it had up to 6 developers and was being used on several
            internal projects as
            well as externally. Since then it has become one of the accepted OSS contenders for
            GUI and acceptance testing and has taken on a life of its own.<br/>

            A feature rich fork of the official Fit.NET project. I ported a bit of the POI
            project to .NET to support excel files and also added a web frontend. Some
            of my changes have been rolled back into Fit.NET. I founded this project with
            Steve Freeman, and maintained it for over a year.<br/>

            This is a small tool I wrote that is widely used in QuickStarts that generates a cardwall in visio
            from a master story list in excel.  This allows you to enter cards from a table into excel turn them into visio,
            print them out, and then continue making modifications on the table.<br/>

        Chizzle - A Browser Based Ruby IDE</h3>
        <ul>
            This is my third attempt at writing a Ruby IDE.  This one is interesting because instead of using a
            UI library, we decided to try using AJAX as the UI for it.  It is not yet stable.<br/>
