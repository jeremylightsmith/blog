      <p>I would love to give you a bid. Feel free to call, email, or submit a description of what you're looking for and I'll get back to you quickly to arrange a&nbsp;projection of work and prices.</p>
      <p>We can provide a quote or&nbsp;work hourly, sometimes a mix of both.&nbsp;Whichever is&nbsp;best for your setting.</p>
      <p>You are put on the schedule and kept clearly informed of start, progression and end dates.</p>
      <p>I keep my work phone on me and you are&nbsp;welcome to call me with questions.</p>
