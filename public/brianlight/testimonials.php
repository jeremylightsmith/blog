<p>Over many years of&nbsp;building projects, I have built several strong relationships. These relationships are as important to me as the projects they come from.  </p>
<p>Here are a few testimonials from clients I have done work for.</p>

<h3>Buddy &amp; Sherry<br>Dewey</h3>
<p>Brian has done many projects for us over the years that we have been very pleased with.  He is able to do anything â€“ from laying tile to fixing the roof.  He is on time, does what he says he will do and goes the extra mile in the clean up.  His prices are reasonable and fair.  Not only that, but I trust him with the key to my house or cabin.  </p>
<p>We always think of Brian when something needs to be added on or fixed.  </p>

<h3>Ronald R. Madson</h3>
<p>I have known Brian Light since the fall of 1999. &nbsp;I owned an apartment complex and he was involved with various contract work / improvements for us from the fall of 1999 until I sold the apartments in the fall of 2005. &nbsp;Then, from August of 2004 to the present, he has also been involved in renovating an old 1870 home I purchased for&nbsp;&nbsp;my law office. &nbsp;This involved very extensive and highly skilled work over a period of four to five months.</p>
<p>My experience in working with Brian Light has been such that I would give 100% recommendation to anyone seeking his services. &nbsp;First and foremost, I trust his integrity and loyalty. &nbsp;Secondly, he is very highly skilled and proficient and he has been able to handle all kinds of renovations and remodeling. &nbsp;He has years and years of experience and good judgement as to solving problems that arise in construction of all types.</p>
<p>Brian has been very patient and accommodating in accomplishing the projects we have given him and I, and my family, consider him a trusted friend.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would highly recommend his services to anyone needing a top quality contractor.
