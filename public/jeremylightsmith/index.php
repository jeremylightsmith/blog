    <p>
      If you're curious about how I might be able to help you, just ask! Generally I'll be pretty upfront about my availability for new work over email / phone. Whether or not I'm available, I'm always happy to sit down with you (especially if you're in Seattle) for coffee or lunch. During this time, let's talk about your situation. Are there any resources that would help you right now? Might I be a good fit for you? Might I be able to refer you to someone else?
    </p>
    <p>
      If this sounds good, the next step is to meet your team and think about what an engagement might look like. Let's agree on a rate for me to spend a day to a week with your team. We will talk, we might do a retrospective, and start to get an idea of what you need.
    </p>
    <p>
      Assuming everyone still wants to go forward, I'll want to sit down with "check signer" and agree to what the engagement will look like. I'll put together a contract that captures that, and we can get to work!
    </p>

      If you ask any of my previous clients, there are a few things that set me apart :
    </p>
    <h4>Stickies &amp; Exercises</h4>
    <p>
      More than once I've been accused of having stock in 3M... I use stickies, and a huge toolbox of exercises to unleash everyone on problems. I favor getting a group (even a big group) into a room to make decisions and generate alignment and ownership. It sometimes requires a good deal of facilitation and preparation, but in my experience the results are worth it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This experiential approach carries over to my training. I believe that in a learning situation, the person doing the talking is also the one doing the learning. So I try to talk the least when I'm helping a team come up to speed. I guide teams through games &amp; simulations followed by debriefs to help them discover the next step for themselves.
    </p>
    <h4>Versatility</h4>
    <p>
      I've worked quite intimately with senior leadership of fortune 500 companies as we have thought about how to bring about change across the organization. I've also worked with middle management as they try to understand their roles in an "agile" world. I've even run my own tech startup, and at this point have started 4 companies. At the same time, I'm just as at home sitting next to a developer, and pair programming with them, coaching them on good development practices. 
    </p>
    <p>
      It's rare for someone to be able to wear so many hats and still be able to go deep. For me this is fun, and it allows me to carry the conversation to the people that need to have it wherever they sit organizationally.

      "It's one thing to talk about 'rapid experimentation' and 'validated learning' as abstract concepts. It's quite another to see them in action, in a real-world setting."
