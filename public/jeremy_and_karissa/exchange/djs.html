<p class="from">Sacramento, CA</p>
<p>Laura had her first stab at DJing at a blues party in Vancouver, WA in July 2005. Her set went so well with the crowd that she was asked to DJ the following night at another party over the state line in Portland. After that weekend she was hooked and has proceeded to spend hours and hours searching for new tunes to spin. She&#8217;s DJed at weekend events and blues parties in Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Chico, Reno, Utah, Sacramento, and most recently at an after after hours party at SoFlex &#8217;07.</p>
<p>She would describe her style as a mesh of blues, swing, r&amp;b, funk and soul. If its got ass, she&#8217;ll play it.</p>

<p class="from">Seattle, WA</p>
<p>When Martin (aka <a href="http://lindychef.com/">Lindy Chef</a>) steps into the booth and spins, there&#8217;s no hidden agenda, just a desire to get into the groove. It usually results in a fantastic blend of slide guitar, hot jass and R&amp;B, with a good amount of soul and gospel sprinkled in.</p>
<p>Oh, and he likes to dance too</p>
