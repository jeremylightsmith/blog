<strong>Q:</strong> What is a lindy exchange?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> A lindy exchange is a weekend long event where a city invites <a href="#lindy_hop">Lindy Hop</a> dancers from elsewhere to come and dance.  All the dancers in the city offer up their couches and spare mattress and patches of floor, and people come, get driven around and have a good time.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re expanding the concept of a lindy exchange and throwing our own lindy exchange for our family, friends, and anyone else that wants to come.</p>
