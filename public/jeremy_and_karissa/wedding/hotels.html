      <h1>Hotels in Neah Bay</h1>
<p>The actual wedding is in Neah Bay, but before and after the wedding some people want to stay in Seattle, click <a href="#seattle">here</a> for seattle hotels.</p>
<h2>Hobuck Beach Resort</h2>
<p><img src="/jeremy_and_karissa/images/hobuck.jpg" class="left"/></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve rented all of <a href="http://hobuckbeachresort.com/">Hobuck Beach Resort&#8217;s</a> cabins in Neah Bay for the Friday night of our wedding.  At the incredible rate of $90 / cabin.  If you plan to stay in the cabins, please split this cost with your cabinmates and reimburse us once you&#8217;re here.  If you need to have cabinspace on Thursday, please <a href="contact_us">contact us</a> immediately, and we&#8217;ll make sure we have enough cabins.  They are new units and very nice, complete w/ kitchenette.</p>
<p>There are 21 cabins, 18 of which have bed space for 4 people, the other 3 have bed space for 6.  We are expecting a lot of people, so we may be asking you to share cabins with other family, and if you&#8217;re willing, to bring and/or sleep on air mattresses or sleeping bags.</p>
<p>If you need space in a cabin, you should be on this list : <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2jgjrw">Cabin Sleeping Arrangements</a>.  If you&#8217;re not, then talk to <a href="contact_us">us</a></p>
<p>In addition to the cabins, Hobuck Beach Resort also offers camping spaces for $15 and RV spaces for $25.</p>
<p>There aren&#8217;t many other options in Neah Bay, and this place is definitely the nicest of them.</p>
<h2>Neah Bay Community Center</h2>
<p><em>Especially for all you swing dancers and adventurous relatives out there&#8230;</em></p>
<p>You can stay for free on the floor of the dance hall where we&#8217;re holding our reception.  So, if the cabins are all full of relatives, or you&#8217;re flat broke, or just want to take part in the biggest slumber party Neah Bay has ever seen, rest assured, there will be extra space on the dance floor :).  Keep in mind it might be hard to sleep until the last dance is done.</p>

<h1>Hotels in Seattle</h1>
<p>June is the beginning of the tourist season in Seattle.  On one hand that means it&#8217;s a great time to visit &#8211; Seattle is one of the most beautiful places in the world during its summer.  On the other hand, it means hotels are a bit more pricey than they are the rest of the year.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to know more about what Seattle has to offer, go check out the excellent <a href="http://visitseattle.org/visitors/">http://visitseattle.org/</a></p>
<p>If you plan on visiting around Seattle and not actually staying <em>in</em> Seattle, feel free to leave any stuff you don&#8217;t need at our house.  Just talk to <a href="/wedding/contact_us">Jeremy</a></p>
<h2>Holiday Inn Express</h2>
<p><img src="http://www.ichotelsgroup.com/hotelmedia/repository/hotelimages/SEAWA/WELCM_EXTR_01_E.jpg" class="right"/></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ichotelsgroup.com/h/d/ex/1/en/hotel/seawa?rpb=hotel&amp;crUrl=/h/d/hi/1/en/hotelsearchresults">Holiday Inn Express</a> in Seattle is our official Seattle hotel.  We&#8217;ve negotiated a rate of $159 for either a King or double Queen room.  We have 7 rooms blocked for our use and we can add more if we need to.</p>
<p>To make a reservation, call the Holiday Inn Express in Seattle at 206-674-6261, or call the Holiday Inn Express Central Reservations at 1-800-465-4329 and ask for the wedding party block, &#8220;Stell-Smith/Light Wedding party&#8221;.  You can make a reservation under this block anytime before May 20th, 2008.</p>
<p>This hotel is 4 blocks away from Seattle&#8217;s <a href="http://www.spaceneedle.com/">Space Needle</a> and <a href="http://www.pacsci.org/">Science Center</a>.  And within Seattle&#8217;s &#8220;Ride Free&#8221; zone.  This means you can catch buses within downtown for free to all the tourist attractions there.  Parking is $10 a day if you have a car.</p>
<p>Fred set this up, so direct any questions to <a href="/wedding/contact_us">him</a></p>
<h2>Seafair Inn</h2>
<p><img src = "http://www.seafairinnseattle.com/templates/110/img/user/masked/SEAFAIRINNSEATTLE.COM.jpg" class="left"/></p>
<p>The <a href="http://seafairinnseattle.com/">Seafair Inn</a> is a budget alternative to the Holiday Inn.  Through <a href="http://hotels.com">hotels.com</a> you can get rooms there around $81 / night.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a motel, and is 7 miles north of downtown.  Rooms aren&#8217;t as nice, but if you have a car and plan on driving around, it&#8217;s within 15 minutes of downtown and all the action.  It&#8217;s also right by our wonderful zoo, and pretty close to a couple of our favorite beaches in Seattle.</p>
